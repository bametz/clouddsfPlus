# Cloud Decision Support Framework Plus (CloudDSF+)
The Cloud Decision Support Framework Plus (CloudDSF+) is a refined and extended version of the [CloudDSF Prototype](https://github.com/adarsow/clouddsf). The framework supports decision makers to derive a migration strategy for legacy applications to the cloud. The CloudDSF+ Prototype is part of the master's thesis "Refinement and Extension of the Cloud Decision Support Framework for Application Migration to the Cloud" from the [Institute of Architecture of Application Systems](http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/indexE.php) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
